        Startups is the need of India. India is a country where unemployment rate
        is more as compare to other countries. People keeps blaming that this is
        due to current PM, CM, population, etc. But this is not the case I
        think.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think skills and the right mindset matters a lot, there are many
        peoples, who have wasted so much money on degrees (here I am not saying
        that degrees are not important) but they have not invested the money
        into learning the skills to get a job. And they keep on thinking that I
        have degree but don't have any job in my field. They simply don't ask
        themselves the question ' I deserve this role or not'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if they look inside themselves they can clearly see that they don't
        have any skill needed for that job. Even if we talk about Indian families, they expect their children to crack competitive exams and get a government job. So What should you do when you are not
        getting a job?(Here I am not talking about government jobs) I think you should start investing in yourself by
        learning the relevant skill for that job or I would say if you are not
        interested in learing any skill then I think you should start a
        business, at least give it a try, no need to invest more money in
        starting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Successful peoples says that 'starts with what you have'. I have seen
        many YouTubers interview, most of them told that 'There is no need to go
        with fancy equipments or camera if you want to be a YouTuber'. Same
        holds true for everything 'starts with what you have', don't think of
        making big investment in starting. What many peoples think that I don't
        have enough money to start, this is a lie you keep telling to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have seen many peoples around you, who started from small and
        scaled their small business, even you didn't notice it then, but after
        years you start noticing that they are doing great and also they
        expanded their business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incomes tax department found that more than 200 peoples are millionaires
        in India( how they became millionaire, they started from small stall, or
        we can say that from small food van). Here point is not that you can be
        a millionaire or you should also start with stall, even I say this, you
        will not do, the point is these peoples are not educated and they did
        very well then think what you can do, being a literate person. What
        matters here is hard work. Now a days, a graduated is making less
        money.On the other hand, a person is making money selling fast food in
        front of that graduated person's office. Chayoos, wow momos, chai sutta
        bar are the example of some businesses which started small and now they
        scaled to the next level.
      </p>

        You may be heard a name or not, but you should know the name of this
        person and where he is right now, he started a small tea stall and he is
        popular enterpreneur. He is Prafull Billore, famous with the name of MBA
        chaiwala. His business turnover is around 3 crore last year, and he
        expanded to many cities with around more that 10 franchise. He is
        planning to expand out of India also.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even a person name Munaf Kapadia quit his job, to sells samosas. You may
        be wondering then what, actually he used to work in google, dream
        company for many of us and he quit that high paying job to start Bohri
        Kitchen.
      </p>

        You can start your own business, I know it's not easy to start a
        business but what else option do you have. You are not getting your
        dream job, then what will you do. suppose you are interested into sales
        but you are not getting job, then there are two options, either you go
        for another job (another field) or start business. I think option two is
        good. If you start a small business then definetly you can solve your
        biggest problem of being unemployed, and if it starts making profit then
        you can't do it alone, may be you have to hire one, or more people
        according to the your requirement. So here you solved two problems first
        you got yourself a job ( you employed yourself) and second you hired
        someone who was also unemplyed.
