        Startups is the need of India India is a country where unemployment rate
        is more as compare to other countries. People keeps blaming that this is
        due to current PM, CM, etc. But this is not the case I think. I think
        skills matters, there are many peoples, who have wasted so much money on
        degrees but they have not invested the money into learning the skills to
        get a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        And they keep on thinking that I have degree but don't have any job
        offer in my field. They simply don't ask themselves the question ' I
        deserve this role or not'. Even if they look inside themselves they can
        clearly see that they don't have any skill needed for that job. You can
        start your own business, I know it's not easy to start a business but
        what else option do you have. You are not getting your dream job, then
        what will you do.
      </p>
      <p>
        suppose you are interested into sales but you are not getting job, then
        there are two options, either you go for another job (another field) or
        start business. I think option two is good. If you start a small
        business then definetly you can solve your biggest problem of being
        unemployed, and if it starts making profit then you can't do it alone,
        may be you have to hire 1, or more people according to the your
        requirement. So here you solved two problems first you got yourself a
        job ( you employed yourself) and second you hired someone who was also
        unemplyed.
