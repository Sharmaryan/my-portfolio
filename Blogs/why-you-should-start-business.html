        Startups are the need of India. India is a country where the unemployment rate is more as compare to other countries. People keep blaming that this is due to current PM, CM, population, etc. But this is not the case I think.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        I think skills and the right mindset matters a lot, there are many peoples, who have wasted so much money on degrees (here I am not saying that degrees are not important) but they have not invested the money into learning the skills to get a job. And they keep on thinking that I have a degree but don't have any job in my field. They simply don't ask themselves the question ' I deserve this role or not.
      </p>
      <p>

        Even if they look inside themselves they can see that they don't have any skill needed for that job. Even if we talk about Indian families, they expect their children to crack competitive exams and get a government job. So What should you do when you are not getting a job? (Here I am not talking about government jobs) I think you should start investing in yourself by learning the relevant skill for that job or I would say if you are not interested in learning any skill then I think you should start a business, at least give it a try, no need to invest more money in starting.
      </p>

        Successful peoples say that 'starts with what you have. I have seen many YouTubers interview, most of them told that 'There is no need to go with any type of equipment, DSLR camera if you want to be a YouTuber'. The same is true for everything 'starts with what you have, don't think of making a big investment in starting. What many peoples think that I don't have enough money to start, this is a lie you keep telling to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>

        You may have seen many peoples around you, who started from small and scaled their small business, even you didn't notice it then, but after years you start noticing that they are doing great and also they expanded their business.
      </p>
      <p>

        Incomes tax department found that more than 200 peoples are millionaires in India( how they became millionaires, they started from a small stall, or we can say that from small food van). Here the point is not that you can be a millionaire or you should also start with stall, even I say this, you will not do, the point is these peoples are not educated and they did very well then think what you can do, being a literate person.
        <br> What matters here is hard work. Nowadays, a graduate is making less money. On the other hand, a person is making money selling fast food in front of that graduated person's office. Chayoos, wow momos, chai sutta bar are the example of some businesses which started small and now they scaled to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>

        You may be heard a name or not, but you should know the name of this person and where he is right now, he started a small tea stall and he is a popular entrepreneur. He is Prafull Billore, famous with the name of MBA chaiwala. His business turnover is around 3 crores last year, and he expanded to many cities with more than 10 franchises. He is planning to expand out of India also.
      </p>
      <p>

        Even a person name Munaf Kapadia quit his job, to sells samosas. You may be wondering then what, actually he used to work in Google, a dream company for many of us and he quit that high paying job to start Bohri Kitchen.
      </p>

        You can start your own business, I know it's not easy to start a business but what else options do you have. You are not getting your dream job, then what will you do. suppose you are interested in sales but you are not getting a job, then there are two options, either you go for another job (another field) or start a business.  I think option two is good. <br>If you start a small business then definitely you can solve your biggest problem of being unemployed, and if it starts making a profit then you can't do it alone, may be you have to hire one, or more people according to your requirement. So here you solved two problems first you got yourself a job ( you employed yourself) and second, you hired someone who was also unemployed.
