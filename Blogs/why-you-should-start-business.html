        Startups is the need of India India is a country where unemployment rate
        is more as compare to other countries. People keeps blaming that this is
        due to current PM, CM, etc. But this is not the case I think. let's talk
        about jobs first I think skills and the right mindset matters a lot,
        there are many peoples, who have wasted so much money on degrees but
        they have not invested the money into learning the skills to get a job.
        And they keep on thinking that I have degree but don't have any job
        offer in my field. They simply don't ask themselves the question ' I
        deserve this role or not'. Even if they look inside themselves they can
        clearly see that they don't have any skill needed for that job. What
        should you do when you are not getting a job, I think you should start
        investing in yourself by learning the relevant skill for that job or I
        would say if you are not interested in learing any skill the I think you
        should start a business, at least give it a try.

        You may have seen many peoples around you, who started from small and
        scaled their small business, even you don't notice it then, but after
        years you start noticing that they are doing great and also they
        expanded their business. Incomes tax department found that more than 200
        peoples are millionaires in India( how they became millionaire, they
        started from small stall, or we can say that from small food van). Here
        point is not that you can be a millionaire or you should also start with
        stall, even I say this, you will not do, the point is these peoples are
        not educated and they did very well then think what you can do, being a
        litterate person.

        Chayoos, wow momos, chai sutta bar are the example of some businesses.
        You may be heard a name or not, but you should know the name of this
        person and where he is right now, he started a small tea stall and he is
        popular enterpreneur. He is Prafull Billore, famous with the name of MBA
        chaiwala. His business turnover is around 3 crore last year, and he
        expanded to many cities with around more that 10 franchise. He is
        planning to expand out of India also.

        You can start your own business, I know it's not easy to start a
        business but what else option do you have. You are not getting your
        dream job, then what will you do. suppose you are interested into sales
        but you are not getting job, then there are two options, either you go
        for another job (another field) or start business. I think option two is
        good. If you start a small business then definetly you can solve your
        biggest problem of being unemployed, and if it starts making profit then
        you can't do it alone, may be you have to hire 1, or more people
        according to the your requirement. So here you solved two problems first
        you got yourself a job ( you employed yourself) and second you hired
        someone who was also unemplyed.
