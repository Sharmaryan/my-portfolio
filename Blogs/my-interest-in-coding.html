    <p>first of all let me tell you a little bit about myself, hello this is aryan sharma. I am pursuing Masters of Computer Applications (M.C.A). I am learning web development.</p>
    <p>
     
        It all starts in 2016 when I enetered in college, first day we were introduced to C language. I was not aware what programming is at that time. Even I was not interested in pursuing B.C.A (Bachelor of Computer Applications). Anyway, let's move with the story ahead, there was our lab class.
    </p>
    <p>
       In that class I was introduced by programming language,C  and the first program was " Write a program to print hello world on the screen". When our professor told us about execution of the program and I executed it, after that I was wondering how this can happen, I wrote a text in the printf() statement and it is showing up on the screen. I took a little interest in it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After that I start learning C language by a book 'Let us C' and actually it was a great book for beginners. So there were some programming questions exercises in the book and I keep trying to solve them but I was struggling with the logic a lot. I was good in theory, but when it comes to logic, I was getting failed at it, I wonder how, some  students in my class can make logics easily, I am struggling with logics, why?
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I came to know that these students already did some classes on C language, even they have computer science in their intermediate class. After some time I stopped coding thinking that may be this is not for me. Nobody told me at that time, practice with consistency is important.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated in 2019 and got a job oppurtunity in digital marketing field in Noida, but I left that job after 10 days, you may be wondering, why? that company's CEO keeps on saying that trainer will come today. And this keeps happening daily, so I took a decision to left the job, you may be thinking how I get into digital marketing.

    </p>
    <p>
        So when I was struggling with coding, I left it, and then get to know that digital marketing field is going to boom in the upcoming years. And I was thinking that why not to give it a try, and I started learning from many of the blogs like Neil Patel, Backlinko, etc.
