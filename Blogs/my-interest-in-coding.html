      First of all let me tell you a little bit about myself, hello I am Aryan Sharma. I am pursuing Masters of Computer Applications (M.C.A). I am learning web development. </p>
      <p>

        It all starts in 2016 when I entered college, on day one we were introduced to C language. I was not aware what programming is, at that time. Even I was not interested in pursuing B.C.A (Bachelor of Computer Applications). Anyway, let's move with the story ahead, there was our lab class.
        In that class, I was introduced to the programming language, C and the first program was " Write a program to print hello world on the screen". When our professor told us about the execution of the program and I executed it, after that I was wondering how this can happen, I wrote a text in the printf() statement and it is showing up on the screen. I took a little interest in it.
      </p>
      <p>

        After that I start learning C language by a book 'Let us C' and it was a great book for beginners. So there were some programming questions exercises in the book and I keep trying to solve them but I was struggling with the logic a lot. I was good in theory, but when it comes to logic, I was getting failed at it, I wonder how, some students in my class can make logic easily, I am struggling with logic, why?
      </p>
      <p>

        Then I came to know that these students already did some classes on C language, even they have computer science in their intermediate class, so they already know to program. After some time I stopped coding thinking that maybe this is not for me. I was able to understand the code but was not able to make logic all by myself. Nobody told me at that time, practice with consistency is important.
      </p>
      <p>

        I graduated in 2019 and got a job opportunity in the digital marketing field in Noida, but I left that job after 10 days, you may be wondering, why? that company's CEO keeps on saying that trainer will come today. And this keeps happening daily, so I decided to leave the job, you may be thinking about how I get into digital marketing.
      </p>
      <p>

        So when I was struggling with coding, I left it, and then get to know that the digital marketing field is going to boom in the upcoming years. And I was thinking that why not give it a try, and I started learning from many of the blogs like Neil Patel, Backlinko, etc.
      </p>
      <p>

        After I quit that job, then I start looking for another one, but after that 2020 came and lockdown happened. So I enrolled in many courses like Facebook Ads, Moz SEO course, etc. These courses were paid but many instructors make those courses free for everyone. So I start learning from them, I was watching videos but I was not getting anything back from these courses. Like for Facebook ads, you really have to do them practically otherwise how can you learn without applying it in the real world, and that is also the case with SEO, you have to practically do them like on-page SEO, off-page SEO. For example: If you want to learn to swim, you can't do it until you get started by going into the water. I would say I know the theory part of these but when it comes to the practical world I was not aware of how to do all these things in the real world. So after that, I kept on thinking that what should I do next, then I came to know about web development.
      </p>
      <p>

        Even it is also coding, but what looks interested to me in web development is, we write code and we can make our website, can changes color, fonts, can add images, we can see those changes in front of our eyes and then after that I started doing it. Even web development also needs logic, and I made a little progress. I am not saying I am an expert but I improved myself. But there was inconsistency because of online college classes. Around April 2021, I was looking for web development videos on YouTube and then a channel's video appeared then I clicked and start watching. The channel name was Tanay Pratap, and he teach the concepts very well. I learned how to host a website, learned about GitHub, the CLI app, and many more things.
      </p>
      <p>

        One thing I learned is when itâ€™s come to coding, you have to make projects, a lot of projects to understand the concepts. I think watching tutorials will not get you out of tutorial hell. To do that you have to practice and after watching any videos try to code yourself.
